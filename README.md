# @yourd/did-parser: A Decentralized Identifier (DID) Parser

[YourD](https://www.yourd.xyz/) provides a user-friendly Web3.0 infrastructure enabling you to easily build Web3.0 products. 
The `@yourd/did-parser` is a sophisticated library meticulously crafted for parsing and managing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). Its core foundation is built upon the esteemed DID specification standards set by the **W3C**.

üìå **Key Features**:
- **Precision in Parsing**: Harnesses advanced algorithms to ensure accurate DID parsing.
- **W3C Conformance**: Adheres strictly to the [DID Core Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) by W3C, guaranteeing reliability and industry-standard compliance.
- **Flexible and Robust**: Designed to accommodate various DID structures while maintaining robustness.

üìò For those keen on understanding the intricacies of the DID specification, we recommend diving into the [official W3C documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

## Introduction

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for verifiable, self-sovereign digital identities. DIDs are fully under the control of the DID subject, independent from any centralized registry, authority, or intermediary.

The `@yourd/did-parser` aims to provide a robust solution for applications and systems to correctly interpret and handle these identifiers.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @yourd/did-parser
```

or 

```bash
yarn add @yourd/did-parser
```

## Supported DID Syntax
According to the DID specification, the general syntax of a DID is:

```plaintext
did:[method-name]:[method-specific-id]
```

did is a fixed string.
- `[method-name]` is a string that specifies the DID method. It is case-insensitive and must be a string from the set of lowercase alphanumeric characters.
- `[method-specific-id]` is a method-specific identifier.
The yourdi-parser ensures that DIDs are correctly parsed and validated based on the above syntax.


**Specifications:**

- `did`: A constant string that indicates the identifier is a DID.
- `[method-name]`: Specifies the DID method and adheres to the following characteristics:
  - **Type**: String
  - **Case Sensitivity**: Insensitive
  - **Valid Characters**: Lowercase alphanumeric characters
  - **Description**: A string that describes the DID method and is integral in determining how the DID interacts with a verifiable data registry.
- `[method-specific-id]`: A method-specific identifier which is unique to the DID.

## Parsing DID URLs

In addition to basic DIDs, the `@yourd/did-parser` is also capable of parsing DID URLs, which extend the basic DID format to include additional components such as paths, query parameters, and fragments.

The general structure of a DID URL is:

```plaintext
did:[method-name]:[method-specific-id][path][?query][#fragment]
```

- did: A constant prefix indicating the identifier type.
- [method-name]: Represents the specific DID method being utilized.
- [method-specific-id]: A unique identifier specific to the chosen method.
- [path]: (Optional) A hierarchical path.
- [?query]: (Optional) A query component which provides additional information.
- [#fragment]: (Optional) A fragment identifier to indicate a secondary resource.

## üìú Conformance to W3C Specification

**@yourd/did-parser** strictly adheres to the **W3C's DID Core Specification**, ensuring:

- ‚úÖ **Accuracy and Reliability**: DIDs and DID URLs are parsed and handled with the utmost precision.
- üîÑ **Syntactical Correctness**: Guarantees that DIDs are syntactically correct as per the standard.
- üåê **Compatibility and Interoperability**: Ensures seamless integration across different platforms and systems that leverage DIDs.

üìò For a deeper dive into the DID Core Specification, readers are highly encouraged to explore the [official W3C documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

## Usage

### Importing the Parser
```js
import { Parser } from '@yourd/did-parser';
```
### Parsing a DID
To parse a DID string:

```js
const parser = new Parser();
const parsedDID = parser.parseDID('did:example:123');
```

If the DID string is valid, parsedDID will contain the method and methodSpecificId. If not, it will return null.

### Parsing a DID URL
To parse a DID URL:

```js
const parsedDIDURL = parser.parseDIDURL('did:example:123/path?query=value#fragment');
```

A valid DID URL will return an object containing the method, methodSpecificId, and optionally, pathAbempty, query, and fragment.

### Assurance with @yourd/did-parser

The `@yourd/did-parser` ensures rigorous parsing and validation, affirming that DIDs are syntactically correct and conform to the established DID syntax, providing a layer of assurance and reliability in DID operations.
